## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Camera integration with real-time ball detection in UI
- Ball detection indicator in header (shows detection status)
- Camera tab with live MJPEG stream and detection overlay
- Hough circle transform as default ball detector (replaces YOLO dependency)
- ByteTrack object tracking for persistent ball identification
- Club speed detection and smash factor calculation
- Rolling buffer mode for experimental spin rate detection
- Session logging to JSONL files (`~/openflight_sessions/`)
- I/Q streaming mode with FFT and 2D CFAR noise rejection
- `--hough-param2` flag for tuning detection sensitivity
- `--mode rolling-buffer` flag for spin detection
- `--session-location` and `--log-dir` flags for session logging
- Roboflow API integration as optional detection backend
- YOLO performance tuning documentation for Raspberry Pi
- ONNX model export support for faster inference
- Threaded camera capture for improved FPS
- Rolling buffer spin detection documentation

### Changed
- Default ball detection uses Hough circles instead of YOLO (no ML model required)
- Camera enabled by default in kiosk mode (use `--no-camera` to disable)
- Dropped Python 3.9 support (requires >=3.10)
- Updated Raspberry Pi setup guide with camera UI instructions

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-01

- Debug panel for radar tuning and raw readings
- Mock mode for development without hardware
- Kiosk mode script for Raspberry Pi deployment
- Systemd service for auto-start on boot
- Camera module for launch angle detection (experimental)
- Camera-based ball tracking for launch angle
- Club type selection (Driver through PW)

### Changed
- Migrated from CDM324/HB100 radar to OPS243-A
- Improved carry distance estimation model

## [0.1.0] - 2024-10-01

### Added
- Initial OPS243-A radar driver
