    Ultra-low-latency GPIO passthrough trigger using Pi as voltage booster.

    Wiring:

        Pi GPIO27 (output, default) → OPS243-A HOST_INT (J3 Pin 3)

    How it works:
        1. GATE goes HIGH (~2.5V) on sound detection
        2. Pi GPIO input detects edge (threshold ~1.8V, faster than HOST_INT)
        3. lgpio callback immediately sets GPIO output HIGH (3.3V)
        4. Radar HOST_INT receives clean 3.3V signal, triggers buffer dump
        5. Python waits for I/Q data on serial (existing wait_for_hardware_trigger)

    Trigger latency: ~10μs (hardware + C callback), vs 1-18ms for software S!

    Physical pin mapping:
        GPIO17 = Physical pin 11
        GPIO27 = Physical pin 13
