  DIY Golf Launch Monitor using the OPS243-A Doppler Radar.
</p>

## Overview

OpenLaunch is an open-source golf launch monitor that measures ball speed using a commercial Doppler radar sensor. The OPS243-A from OmniPreSense provides professional-grade speed measurement (±0.5% accuracy) in a simple USB-connected package.

### What It Measures

- **Ball Speed**: 30-220 mph range with ±0.5% accuracy
- **Estimated Carry Distance**: Based on ball speed (simplified model)

### Hardware

| Component | Description | Cost |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| OPS243-A | OmniPreSense Doppler Radar | ~$225 |
| Raspberry Pi 5 | (or any computer with USB) | ~$80 |
| USB Cable | Micro USB to connect radar | ~$5 |
| **Total** | | **~$310** |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openlaunch.git
cd openlaunch

# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create venv and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .

# For UI support (web interface)
uv pip install -e ".[ui]"
```

### Basic Usage (CLI)

```bash
# Run the launch monitor
openlaunch

# Specify serial port manually
openlaunch --port /dev/ttyACM0

# Show live readings
openlaunch --live

# Show radar info
openlaunch --info
```

### Web UI

```bash
# Build the frontend (first time only)
cd ui && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Run the UI server with radar
openlaunch-server

# Run in mock mode (no radar needed, for development)
openlaunch-server --mock
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in a browser.

For kiosk mode on Raspberry Pi (fullscreen):
```bash
chromium-browser --kiosk http://localhost:8080
```

### Python API

```python
from openlaunch import LaunchMonitor

# Simple usage
with LaunchMonitor() as monitor:
    print("Swing when ready...")
    shot = monitor.wait_for_shot(timeout=60)

    if shot:
        print(f"Ball Speed: {shot.ball_speed_mph:.1f} mph")
        print(f"Est. Carry: {shot.estimated_carry_yards:.0f} yards")
```

```python
# Continuous monitoring with callbacks
from openlaunch import LaunchMonitor

def on_shot(shot):
    print(f"Shot detected: {shot.ball_speed_mph:.1f} mph")

monitor = LaunchMonitor()
monitor.connect()
monitor.start(shot_callback=on_shot)

# ... do other things ...

stats = monitor.get_session_stats()
print(f"Average ball speed: {stats['avg_ball_speed']:.1f} mph")
```

### Low-Level Radar Access

```python
from openlaunch import OPS243Radar

# Direct radar control
with OPS243Radar() as radar:
    # Get radar info
    info = radar.get_info()
    print(f"Firmware: {info.get('Version')}")

    # Configure for golf
    radar.configure_for_golf()

    # Read speeds
    while True:
        reading = radar.read_speed()
        if reading:
            print(f"{reading.speed:.1f} {reading.unit}")
```

## Setup Guide

### 1. Connect the Radar

Connect the OPS243-A to your computer via USB. The radar will appear as a serial device:
- **Linux/Raspberry Pi**: `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`
- **macOS**: `/dev/tty.usbmodem*`
- **Windows**: `COM3` (or similar)

### 2. Position the Radar

For best results, position the radar **3-5 feet behind the tee**, pointing at the hitting area. The radar has a 23° beam width.

```
                    Ball Flight Direction
                    ======================>

    [Tee]  ←--- 3-5 ft ---→  [OPS243-A Radar]
                                   ↓
                            Points at ball
```

**Important**: The radar measures radial velocity (speed toward/away from sensor). For accurate readings, the ball should travel roughly along the radar's line of sight.

### 3. Run the Monitor

```bash
openlaunch
```

The system will automatically detect the radar, configure it for golf ball detection, and start monitoring.

## How It Works

### Doppler Radar Basics

The OPS243-A transmits a 24 GHz signal. When this signal bounces off a moving object (the golf ball), the frequency shifts proportionally to the object's speed - this is the Doppler effect.

The relationship is:
```
Speed = (Doppler_Frequency × c) / (2 × Transmit_Frequency)
```

At 24.125 GHz, each 1 mph of speed creates a ~71.7 Hz Doppler shift.

### Golf Ball Detection

Golf balls are challenging targets for radar due to:
- **Small size**: ~1.68" diameter
- **Low RCS**: Radar cross-section of ~0.001 m²
- **High speed**: 100-180+ mph for well-struck shots
- **Brief detection window**: Ball is in range for < 100ms

The OPS243-A handles this with:
- High transmit power (11 dBm typical)
- 15 dBi antenna gain
- 24 GHz frequency (short wavelength suits small objects)
- Fast sampling (up to 100k samples/sec)

Based on link budget analysis, the OPS243-A should reliably detect golf balls at **4-5 meters (13-16 feet)**, making the 3-5 foot positioning ideal.

### System Architecture

The data flows from radar to UI like this:

```
┌─────────────┐  USB/Serial  ┌─────────────┐  Callback   ┌─────────────┐  WebSocket  ┌─────────────┐
│  OPS243-A   │ ───────────▶ │   Launch    │ ──────────▶ │   Flask     │ ──────────▶ │   React     │
│   Radar     │  Speed data  │   Monitor   │  on_shot()  │   Server    │   "shot"    │     UI      │
└─────────────┘              └─────────────┘             └─────────────┘             └─────────────┘
```

1. **Radar streams data** - The OPS243-A continuously sends speed readings over USB serial whenever it detects motion

2. **LaunchMonitor processes readings** - A background thread reads serial data, accumulates readings, and when there's a gap (no readings for 0.5s), analyzes the data to create a `Shot` object with ball speed, club speed, and smash factor

3. **Callback fires** - When a shot is detected, the callback function registered via `monitor.start(shot_callback=...)` is called with the `Shot` object

4. **Server broadcasts to clients** - The Flask server's callback converts the shot to JSON and emits it to all connected browsers via WebSocket

5. **React updates UI** - The `useSocket` hook receives the event and updates state, triggering a re-render with the new shot data

This callback pattern keeps the components decoupled - `LaunchMonitor` doesn't know about Flask or WebSockets, it just calls whatever function you give it.

## Configuration

The radar can be configured via API commands:

```python
from openlaunch import OPS243Radar, SpeedUnit, Direction

radar = OPS243Radar()
radar.connect()

# Set units to MPH
radar.set_units(SpeedUnit.MPH)

# Increase sample rate for faster balls (up to 139 mph at 20kHz)
radar.set_sample_rate(20000)

# Filter out slow movements
radar.set_min_speed_filter(20)  # Ignore < 20 mph

# Only detect outbound (ball going away)
radar.set_direction_filter(Direction.OUTBOUND)

# Save to persistent memory
radar.save_config()
```

### Key Settings for Golf

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Sample Rate | 20 kHz | Supports up to ~139 mph |
| Buffer Size | 512 | Faster updates (~10-15 Hz) |
| Min Speed | 10 mph | Filter slow movements |
| Direction | Outbound | Ball moving away from radar |
| Power | Max (0) | Best detection range |

## Limitations

### What OpenLaunch Does NOT Measure

- **Launch Angle**: Requires camera or additional sensors
- **Spin Rate**: Requires high-speed camera
- **Club Speed**: Could be added with timing/positioning changes
- **Side Spin / Curve**: Requires multiple sensors or camera

### Accuracy Considerations

- **Distance estimates are rough**: Without launch angle and spin, carry distance is estimated using a simplified model (~2.5 yards per mph of ball speed)
- **Cosine error**: If ball doesn't travel directly toward/away from radar, measured speed will be slightly lower than actual
- **Detection is probabilistic**: Very fast shots with weak returns may be missed

## Troubleshooting

### "No OPS243 radar found"

1. Check USB connection
2. Try a different USB cable
3. Check if device appears: `ls /dev/tty*` (Linux/Mac)
4. Try specifying port manually: `openlaunch --port /dev/ttyACM0`

### Weak or No Detection

1. Move radar closer to hitting area (try 3 feet)
2. Ensure radar is pointing at ball flight path
3. Check for obstructions
4. Try increasing transmit power: `radar.set_transmit_power(0)`

### Erratic Readings

1. Increase minimum speed filter to reduce noise
2. Increase magnitude filter to require stronger signals
3. Ensure stable mounting (vibration causes false readings)

## Previous CDM324/HB100 Approach

An earlier version of this project attempted to use cheap CDM324/HB100 radar modules with custom amplification. This approach was abandoned due to insufficient detection range (~2-3 feet vs the required ~5-10 feet for practical use). The original code is preserved in the `archive/cdm324_approach/` directory for reference.

The OPS243-A costs more but provides:
- Built-in signal processing
- Higher transmit power
- Better antenna design
- Reliable detection at practical distances
